Subject: [PATCH v5 00/12] non-init user namespaces for FUSE

This patchset v5 is based on work by Seth Forshee and Eric Biederman.
The latest patchset was v4:
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1132206.html

At the moment, filesystems backed by physical medium can only be mounted
by the real root in the initial user namespaces. This restriction exists
because if it's allowed for root user in non-init user namespaces to
mount the filesystem, then it effectively allows the user to control the
underlying source of the filesystem. In case of FUSE, the source would
mean any underlying device.

However, in many use cases such as containers, it's necessary to allow
filesystems to be mounted from non-init user namespaces. Goal of this
patchset is to allow FUSE filesystem to be mounted from non-init user
namespaces. Supporting for other filesystems like ext4 are not in the
scope of this patchset.

Let me describe how to test mounting from non-init namespace. It's
assume that tests are done via sshfs, a userspace filesystem based on
FUSE for ssh as backend. Testing system is Fedora 27.

====
$ sudo dnf install -y sshfs
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/userns

### workaround to get the sshfs permission checks
$ sudo chown -R $UID:$UID /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d /usr/share/crypto-policies

$ unshare -U -r -m
# sshfs root@localhost: /mnt/userns

### You can see sshfs being mounted from non-init user namespace
# mount | grep sshfs
root@localhost: on /mnt/userns type fuse.sshfs
(rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0)

# touch /mnt/userns/test
# ls -l /mnt/userns/test
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Dec 11 19:01 /mnt/userns/test
====

Open another terminal, check the mountpoint from outside the namespace.

====
$ grep userns /proc/$(pidof sshfs)/mountinfo
131 102 0:35 / /mnt/userns rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime - fuse.sshfs
root@localhost: rw,user_id=0,group_id=0
====

After all tests are done, you can unmount the filesystem,
inside the namespace.

====
# fusermount -u /mnt/userns
====

Changes since v4:
 * Remove other parts like ext4 to keep the patchset minimal for FUSE
 * Added and changed commit messages
 * Describe about how to test non-init user namespaces

Patches 1-2 deal with an additional flag of lookup_bdev() to check for
additional inode permission.

Patches 3-7 allow superblock owner to change ownership of inodes, and
deal with additional capability checks w.r.t user namespaces.

Patches 8-10 allow FUSE filesystems to be mounted outside of the init
user namespace.

Patch 11 handles a corner case of non-root users in EVM.

Patch 12 disallows unprivileged mount when device is open for writing.

The patchset is also available on our github repo:
