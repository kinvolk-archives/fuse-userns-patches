Subject: [RFC PATCH v4 0/2] ima,fuse: introduce new fs flag FS_IMA_NO_CACHE

This patchset v4 introduces a new fs flag FS_IMA_NO_CACHE and uses it in
FUSE. This forces files to be re-measured, re-appraised and re-audited
on file systems with the feature flag FS_IMA_NO_CACHE. In that way,
cached integrity results won't be used.

There was a previous attempt (unmerged) with a IMA option named "force" and using
that option for FUSE filesystems. These patches use a different approach
so that the IMA subsystem does not need to know about FUSE.
