Subject: [PATCH 0/2] turn on force option for FUSE in builtin policies

In case of FUSE filesystem being mounted from non-init user namespace,
[1] cached integrity results could be used maliciously, when the
userspace FUSE process has changed the underlying files. To be able to
avoid such cases, we need to turn on the force option in builtin
policies, for actions of measure and appraise. Then integrity values
become re-measured and re-appraised. In that way, it's possible to
prevent cached integrity results from being used.

This patchset depends on the patch "ima: define a new policy option
named force" by Mimi. [2]  For details on testing the force option,
please refer to the testing report by Alban. [3]

The first patch is for simply moving FUSE_*SUPER_MAGIC macros to
include/uapi/linux, to be able to use those in other subsystems like
security/integrity/ima.

The second patch is actually to turn on the force option for FUSE fs
in IMA.
